## 💡 Best Practices

### Prompt Engineering Tips

1. **Be Specific**: Clearly define the agent's role and constraints
2. **Use Examples**: Include few-shot examples when appropriate
3. **Structure Output**: Define expected output formats
4. **Handle Edge Cases**: Include error handling instructions
5. **Iterate and Test**: Continuously refine based on results

### Example Prompt Structure

```markdown
You are a [ROLE] expert specializing in [DOMAIN].

Your primary objectives are:
1. [Objective 1]
2. [Objective 2]
3. [Objective 3]

Guidelines:
- [Guideline 1]
- [Guideline 2]
- [Guideline 3]

Output Format:
[Specify the expected output structure]

Examples:
[Provide 1-3 examples if needed]
```
