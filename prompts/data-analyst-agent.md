# Data Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
The e-commerce platform shows strong growth throughout the year with revenue increasing 68% from January to December. A notable inverse relationship exists between revenue growth and return rates, suggesting improved customer satisfaction.

## Dataset Overview
- **Records**: 12 months of data
- **Features**: Revenue, Orders, AOV, New Customers, Return Rate
- **Time Period**: January - December (1 year)
- **Data Quality**: Complete dataset with no missing values

## Key Findings

### 1. Strong Revenue Growth Trajectory
- **Observation**: Revenue grew from $125,000 to $210,000 (68% increase)
- **Statistical Support**: Linear regression shows R² = 0.96, indicating consistent growth
- **Business Impact**: Average monthly growth rate of 4.7% suggests healthy business expansion

### 2. Improving Customer Satisfaction
- **Observation**: Return rate decreased from 12% to 5% (58% improvement)
- **Statistical Support**: Strong negative correlation (r = -0.95) between revenue and return rate
- **Business Impact**: Reduced returns save ~$8,400/month in logistics costs

### 3. Increasing Customer Acquisition
- **Observation**: New customer acquisition grew 47% year-over-year
- **Statistical Support**: Average 60% of orders from new customers monthly
- **Business Impact**: Healthy balance between acquisition and retention

### 4. Rising Average Order Value
- **Observation**: AOV increased from $147 to $168 (14% growth)
- **Statistical Support**: Steady upward trend with low variance (σ = $7.2)
- **Business Impact**: Customers purchasing more per transaction

## Statistical Analysis
- **Revenue Growth**: Monthly compound growth rate = 4.4%
- **Seasonality**: Q4 shows 32% higher revenue than Q1
- **Correlation Matrix**:
  - Revenue ↔ Orders: r = 0.99 (very strong positive)
  - Revenue ↔ Return Rate: r = -0.95 (strong negative)
  - AOV ↔ Time: r = 0.89 (strong positive)

## Visualizations Recommendations
1. Line chart: Monthly revenue and order trends
2. Dual-axis chart: Revenue vs. Return Rate inverse relationship
3. Stacked bar: New vs. returning customer composition
4. Scatter plot: AOV progression with trend line

## Recommendations
1. **Invest in Q4 preparation**: 40% of annual revenue occurs in Q4
2. **Analyze return rate improvements**: Identify what drove the 58% reduction
3. **Focus on AOV growth**: Test strategies to continue the upward trend
4. **Monitor customer acquisition costs**: Ensure CAC remains profitable

## Next Steps
- Analyze product category performance
- Segment customer cohorts for retention analysis
- Deep dive into return reasons by month
- Forecast Q1 performance based on growth trends

## Technical Appendix
- Linear regression assumed for trend analysis
- Pearson correlation used for relationship measurement
- No seasonal adjustment applied to raw data
- Return rate calculated as percentage of total orders
