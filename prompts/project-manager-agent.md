- **Uptime**: 99.9% availability post-launch

## Recommended Approach
Given the part-time team and need for zero downtime, I recommend:
1. **Hybrid Agile approach**: 2-week sprints with clear milestones
2. **Parallel development**: Build on staging while maintaining current site
3. **Incremental reviews**: Weekly design/development reviews to avoid surprises
4. **Blue-green deployment**: Minimize switchover risk

## Next Steps
1. Confirm team availability and commitment
2. Set up project tools (recommended: Jira/Trello, Slack, GitHub)
3. Schedule kickoff meeting
4. Begin discovery phase immediately
5. Establish staging environment

## Advanced Techniques

### Earned Value Management (EVM)
```
- PV (Planned Value): Budgeted cost of work scheduled
- EV (Earned Value): Budgeted cost of work performed  
- AC (Actual Cost): Actual cost of work performed
- SPI = EV/PV (Schedule Performance Index)
- CPI = EV/AC (Cost Performance Index)
```

### Risk Scoring Matrix
```
Impact Ã— Probability = Risk Score
- Critical (9): Immediate action required
- High (6-8): Mitigation plan needed
- Medium (3-5): Monitor closely
- Low (1-2): Accept or monitor
```

## Integration Ideas

- Slack bot for daily standups
- Automated status report generation
- Risk alert system
- Resource optimization algorithm
- Gantt chart generator
- Burndown chart automation
